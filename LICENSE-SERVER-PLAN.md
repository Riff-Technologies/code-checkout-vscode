Below is a revised, detailed architecture plan for an Azure-based service that validates software license keys. This version reflects the new request pattern where the license key is passed via an Authorization header as a Bearer token, along with additional contextual information in the request body (machine ID, session ID, etc.).

1. High-Level Architecture

   1. Client (e.g., VS Code Extension)
      • Sends a POST request to an endpoint (Azure Function URL or behind Azure API Management).
      • Includes:
      • Authorization header: Bearer {licenseKey}
      • Content-Type: application/json
      • Request Body with additional data (machineId, sessionId, environment info, etc.).
   2. Azure API Management (Optional but Recommended)
      • Acts as a secure, managed gateway.
      • Validates the Bearer token format.
      • Can apply rate limiting, IP filtering, and policies before the request reaches the Azure Function.
   3. Azure Function (Serverless Compute)
      • HTTP Trigger handles the incoming request.
      • Extracts the license key from the Authorization header.
      • Retrieves additional request data from the JSON body.
      • Validates the license key against a data store.
      • Logs or audits usage data (e.g., machineId, environment).
      • Responds with JSON indicating whether the license is valid and providing any relevant info (e.g., expiration date, usage limits).
   4. Data Store (Azure Cosmos DB or Azure SQL Database)
      • Stores license records and related usage constraints.
      • Contains tables or collections that link license keys to software IDs, expiration dates, etc.
      • (Optional) Tracks usage history by machineId, sessionId, etc.
   5. Admin Portal (Web App or Static Web App)
      • Allows CRUD operations for license records (create, read, update, delete).
      • Secured with Azure AD or a separate admin token.
   6. Monitoring & Security
      • Application Insights for logs, metrics, tracing.
      • Azure Key Vault for secure storage of secrets (DB connection strings, encryption keys).

2. Request Flow (License Validation)
   1. Client Request

await fetch(API_ENDPOINT, {
method: "POST",
headers: {
"Content-Type": "application/json",
Authorization: `Bearer ${licenseKey}`,
},
body: JSON.stringify({
machineId,
sessionId,
environment: {
vscodeVersion: vscode.version,
extensionVersion: context.extension.packageJSON.version,
platform: os.platform(),
release: os.release(),
},
}),
});

    2.	API Management / Direct Function Call
    •	If using Azure API Management, an inbound policy can check if the Authorization header is present.
    •	If skipping APIM, the Azure Function itself reads the Authorization header.
    3.	Azure Function Processing
    1.	Extract License Key
    •	Parse the Authorization header.
    •	Expect format: Bearer YOUR_LICENSE_KEY.
    •	Validate that a license key was provided; if missing or malformed, return 401 Unauthorized.
    2.	Read Additional Info
    •	Parse JSON body: machineId, sessionId, environment (vscodeVersion, extensionVersion, platform, release).
    3.	Lookup License
    •	Query the data store for the provided license key.
    •	Return 401/403 if not found or if invalid.
    4.	Check License Constraints
    •	Is the license active?
    •	Has the license expired?
    •	Is usage limited by machine or session ID? (optional logic)
    5.	Log Usage (Optional)
    •	Write or update usage logs in the data store: store machineId, sessionId, environment info.
    •	This helps detect suspicious patterns or potential license abuse.
    6.	Return Response
    •	200 OK if the license is valid.
    •	Body could include:

{
"isValid": true,
"expiresOn": "2026-01-01T00:00:00Z",
"message": "License is valid."
}

    •	Or 401/403 if invalid or not found:

{
"isValid": false,
"message": "License not found or expired."
}

3. Data Model

A conceptual model for storing and tracking licenses could look like the following. Adjust field types or naming for your needs.

Field Type Description
id String (GUID or PK) Unique identifier for the record (primary key).
licenseKey String The license key (hash or encrypted if you do not need to retrieve raw).
status String e.g., active, inactive, revoked.
expirationDate DateTime When the license expires.
allowedMachines List (Optional) If you want to restrict to known machine IDs.
usageLogs Array (or separate table/collection) Track usage data (machineId, sessionId, timestamp, environment).
metadata JSON / Object Additional info, e.g., plan type, product name, etc.

Usage Logs / Telemetry

If you want robust logging for each request, store it in a separate collection/table to avoid unbounded growth in the main license record.

Field Type Description
licenseKey String Reference to the license key.
machineId String Machine/host ID provided by the client.
sessionId String Session identifier from the client.
timestamp DateTime When the request was made.
environment JSON Additional environment details (platform, etc.).
requestId GUID Unique ID for the usage record (optional).

4. Azure Services Breakdown

   1. Azure Functions
      • HTTP-triggered function for the main license validation endpoint.
      • (Optional) Timer-triggered function for periodic cleanup (mark expired licenses).
   2. Azure API Management (APIM)
      • Provides a unified API surface, controlling access with OAuth, JWT, or just pass-through.
      • You can define policies for caching, rate-limiting, IP filtering, etc.
      • If not used, the Function can directly parse the Authorization header.
   3. Data Store
      • Azure Cosmos DB:
      • Offers flexible schema, easy global replication, and serverless or auto-scale throughput.
      • Great for JSON storage, including usage logs.
      • Azure SQL Database:
      • Good for structured, relational data with robust querying.
      • Additional overhead if your data model is more dynamic.
   4. Azure Key Vault
      • Securely store connection strings, secrets, or encryption keys.
      • Integrate with Azure Functions via environment variables referencing Key Vault secrets.
   5. Admin Portal
      • Azure App Service or Azure Static Web Apps hosting an admin UI (React, Angular, or even a .NET Web App).
      • Admin endpoints can be secured via Azure AD or a separate admin token.
      • Provides CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations on license records.
   6. Monitoring & Logging
      • Application Insights:
      • Configure for your Azure Function to track request counts, response times, failures, logs, etc.
      • Telemetry and analytics help detect suspicious usage patterns, e.g., multiple machineIds for a single license.

5. Endpoint Specification

Public Endpoint: License Validation
• URL: POST /validate
• Headers:
• Content-Type: application/json
• Authorization: Bearer {licenseKey}
• Body (JSON):

{
"machineId": "MACHINE_ID_STRING",
"sessionId": "SESSION_ID_STRING",
"environment": {
"vscodeVersion": "x.y.z",
"extensionVersion": "a.b.c",
"platform": "win32|darwin|linux",
"release": "OS Release Info"
}
}

    •	Response:

// On valid license
{
"isValid": true,
"expiresOn": "2026-01-01T00:00:00Z",
"message": "License is valid."
}

// On invalid/expired/not found license
{
"isValid": false,
"message": "License is invalid or expired."
}

    •	Status Codes:
    •	200 OK if valid.
    •	401 Unauthorized if missing/invalid bearer token.
    •	403 Forbidden if the license is found but disabled or revoked.
    •	400 Bad Request if request format is incorrect.

Admin Endpoints (Optional Design)
• POST /admin/licenses
• Create a new license.
• GET /admin/licenses
• Retrieve a list of licenses (with optional filters, e.g., by status or expiration).
• GET /admin/licenses/{id}
• Retrieve a specific license record.
• PUT /admin/licenses/{id}
• Update a license (e.g., extend expiration, change status).
• DELETE /admin/licenses/{id}
• Delete or revoke a license.
• Security: Enforce admin-level authentication (e.g., Azure AD, separate admin token).

6. Security Considerations

   1. Bearer Token Parsing
      • Ensure the Authorization header has the format: Bearer {licenseKey}.
      • Do not accept plain or insecure tokens.
      • Return 401 if the header is missing or malformed.
   2. License Key Protection
      • Consider storing licenseKey in your data store as a hashed or encrypted value.
      • If only a hash is stored, you can compare a hashed version of the incoming key to the stored hash.
      • If you need to retrieve the raw license key for some reason, use encryption with a key from Azure Key Vault.
   3. Machine / Session Tracking
      • The additional environment data (machineId, sessionId, etc.) can help mitigate abuse.
      • You could track how many machines or sessions are allowed per license.
      • If usage limit exceeded, mark the license as flagged or invalid for new sessions.
   4. RBAC / Admin Security
      • If you have an Admin Portal, secure it with Azure AD or another identity provider.
      • Implement roles for read-only, super-admin, etc.
   5. Network & Transport Security
      • Enforce HTTPS/TLS for all requests.
      • Optionally, use IP allow-listing or private endpoints (especially for admin access).

7. Additional Considerations
   1. Usage Analytics
      • Use Application Insights or custom logging to track how frequently license keys are used, on how many machines, etc.
      • This could inform your licensing tiers or detect suspicious usage patterns.
   2. Automated Cleanup
      • A Timer-triggered Azure Function could:
      • Scan for expired licenses.
      • Mark them as inactive or trigger notifications.
   3. Scalability
      • Azure Functions on a Consumption or Premium plan scale automatically with load.
      • Cosmos DB or Azure SQL can also scale as needed.
      • For high concurrency, consider concurrency best practices (e.g., partition keys in Cosmos DB).
   4. Cost Management
      • Serverless compute (Functions) plus serverless or auto-scale database options help optimize cost.
      • Monitor usage and scale up/down accordingly.
   5. Testing & Deployment
      • Use GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps to build and deploy your Functions and Web App.
      • Automate integration tests for license validation flows and admin CRUD.

Final Summary

In this revised plan, clients submit the license key using the Authorization: Bearer {licenseKey} header, accompanied by additional context (machineId, sessionId, environment details) in the POST body. The Azure Function (optionally fronted by Azure API Management) retrieves and validates the key against a central data store (Cosmos DB or Azure SQL). Machine and environment data can be logged to help mitigate abuse and track usage patterns.

An optional admin portal provides secure CRUD on license records (active, expired, revoked, etc.). Azure Key Vault and RBAC ensure secrets and admin operations remain protected. Application Insights offers telemetry and monitoring, while automated tasks (timer functions) can handle license cleanup or expiration logic. This end-to-end design should be robust, secure, and scalable for validating software license keys in an Azure-based environment.
